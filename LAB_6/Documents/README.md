Lab. Exercise 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis:

In the Documents folder aside from this document explaining all the basics, there's also Data_Appendix, which describes the variables used in analysis.py and files from Analysis_Data folder and Final_Paper, which is just an empty file in this project.

The Original_Data folder contains the initial database that was given to clean - file called '10_POMORSKIE.csv'.

In the Command_Files folder there's all the code responsible for changes of the data and visualisation. There are comments to separate each section responsible for plotting different variables. The 'analysis.py' file generates the results to Analysis_Data folder.

Sticking to TIER Protocol and tidy data's recommendations I've created a dataframe and visual representation for each of the variables.
In the Analysis_Data there are all the dataframes in .csv format used for visualisation and plots in .png format.
IMPORTANT - in the analysis.py file string variable path_to_change IS TO BE CHANGED if someone wants to reproduce the results after cloning this repository.
In my case it is the path to the repository's main folder. Change it accordingly.

The software used for this analysis:
- Python 3.9.13 in Visual Stude Code (IDE)
- pandas -Version: 1.4.2
- matplotlib 3.5.2 - Python plotting package
- numpy -Version: 1.21.5 

Pandas built-in functions and matploylib package were used to visualise data.
